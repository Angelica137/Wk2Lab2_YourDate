# Your date

Open the 'Date Project' and you will see the 'YorDate' class.

- The documentation for this class can be found from the Week2\Lab3\Date\doc folder.

- Within, Test_YorDate class, create an Object from the YorDate class – (You should use the 2nd constructor that takes the day, month year as parameters). Using the object you have created, test the objects’ methods.

- After creating another date object, you should use the ‘set’ methods to set date1 to your birthday. Then use the ‘get’ methods to display your birthdate.

- Display the day of the week you were born on.
